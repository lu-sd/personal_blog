## git pull

Purpose: Fetch changes from a remote repository and merge them into your current branch.

When you run git pull, it is effectively a combination of two commands:

git fetch: Downloads the latest changes from the remote repository to your local repository but does not merge them.
git merge: Merges the fetched changes into your current branch.
Default behavior: If there are new commits in the remote branch that are not in your local branch, git pull will merge those commits into your current branch.

```bash
git status:

Remote:
A---B---C---D  (origin/main)

Local:
A---B---E---F  (local branch)

git pull

Remote:
A---B---C---D  (origin/main)

Local:
A---B---E---F---M  (local branch)
         \     /
          C---D

```

- M is a new merge commit created by the merge operation.
- The merge commit (M) combines changes from your local commits (E, F) and the remote commits (C, D).
- The history is now non-linear and includes a merge commit.

## git rebase

Purpose: Reapply commits from your current branch on top of target base branch.

When you run git rebase, you are essentially "moving" your commits to start after the most recent commit on the target branch. This creates a linear history, which is often cleaner and easier to understand.

let's consider a scenario where you have a main branch (often called main) and a feature branch (feature-branch). Both branches have some commits, and you want to rebase the feature-branch onto the main branch.

```bash

main branch:
A---B---C---D  (main)

feature-branch:
     \
      E---F---G  (feature-branch)

```

When you run git rebase main on feature-branch, you want to move the feature-branch so that it appears as if it was developed on top of the latest commit on main (commit D), instead of branching off from B.

```bash
git rebase main

A---B---C---D  (main)
             \
              E'---F'---G'  (feature-branch)

```

Key Points:

- The rebase does not change the commits on main (A, B, C, D remain untouched).
- The feature-branch commits are "rebased" onto D, creating a new history for feature-branch.
- After the rebase, your feature-branch appears as if it was created from the latest commit on main (D).

This process makes the history cleaner and linear, avoiding unnecessary merge commits that could clutter the commit history.

## git pull --rebase

It is a best practice in many workflows where a clean commit history is desired. It combines the benefits of keeping your branch up-to-date with the remote branch while avoiding the clutter of merge commits,especially in shared repositories where multiple developers are working on the same codebase.

```bash
git pull --rebase origin main

# This command fetches the latest changes from the main branch of the origin remote and rebases your current branch on top of those changes, effectively updating your branch with the latest code while maintaining a linear history.
```

The most common use case for git pull --rebase is when you are working on a feature branch, and you want to incorporate the latest changes from the main branch without creating unnecessary merge commits.

#### git pull --rebase vs git pull

```bash
git status:

Remote:
A---B---C---D  (origin/main)

Local:
A---B---E---F  (local branch)

git pull --rebase

Remote:
A---B---C---D  (origin/main)

Local:
A---B---C---D---E'---F'  (local branch)

```

When you run git pull --rebase, Git fetches the changes from the remote, and then instead of merging, it rebases your local commits on top of the fetched commits. This avoids creating a merge commit and results in a linear history.

```bash
git pull
#  Merges remote changes into your branch, potentially creating a new merge commit and resulting in a non-linear history.
A---B---E---F---M  (local branch)
       \     /
        C---D
```

```bash
git pull --rebase
# Rebases your local commits on top of the remote changes, creating a linear history without merge commits.
A---B---C---D---E'---F' (local branch)

```
