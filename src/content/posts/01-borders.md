## Border , Outline and Ring

I am a little bit confused when I am learning border ,ring and outline,so what is the differences?

### Border

Purpose: Borders are used to define the edges of an element.
Usage: Applied using various utility classes to set border width, color, and style.
Effect: Modifies the visual appearance of an element by adding borders.
Layout Impact: Affects the layout of the document by taking up space.

```html
<div class=" border-2 border-solid border-blue-500">
  <!-- Content goes here -->
</div>
```

### Outline

Outlines are similar to borders in that they define the edges of an element, but they are typically used for non-visual purposes, such as focus states.

Purpose: Outlines are typically used for non-visual purposes, such as indicating focus states for accessibility.
Usage: Applied using the outline utility, with customization for color, style, width and offset.
Effect: Adds a visible outline around an element, typically used for focus states.
Layout Impact: Does not affect the layout of the document.

Using examples is quite standard in this scenario:

```html
<button class="outline-none focus:outline-blue-500">Click me</button>
```

But this is also working :

```html
<button
  class="outine-1 outline outline-pink-300 focus:outline-none focus:ring-4 focus:ring-violet-300"
>
  Click me
</button>

<button
  class="border border-pink-300 focus:border-none focus:ring-4 focus:ring-violet-300"
>
  Click me
</button>
```

Outlines are stacked outside border, and can sometimes be used as a "second border", for effect.

### Ring

(creating outline rings with box-shadows)

Purpose: Rings are specifically designed for focus states, providing a more customizable alternative to outlines.
Usage: Applied using the ring utility with options for color, offset, opacity, and width.
Effect: Adds a customizable focus ring around an element, primarily for focus states.
Layout Impact: Does not affect the layout of the document.

```html
<button class="ring ring-blue-500 focus:ring-opacity-50 focus:ring-offset-2">
  Click me
</button>
```

> In summary `border` is a general-purpose utility for adding borders to elements, `outline` and `ring` are more specialized for focus states, with outline being a simpler option and ring offering more fine-grained control over the appearance of focus rings.

## Divide

In Tailwind CSS, the `divide-y `utility is used to add a vertical (y-axis) border between sibling elements. When using divide-y, it is typically applied to a parent container, and each child element will automatically receive a border on its bottom edge.

```html
<div class="divide-y divide-dashed divide-gray-500 hover:divide-solid">
  <p class="py-2">First element</p>
  <p class="py-2">Second element</p>
  <p class="py-2">Third element</p>
</div>
```
