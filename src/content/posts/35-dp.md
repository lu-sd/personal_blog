## Grid DP

64:Given a m x n grid filled with non-negative numbers, find a path from top left to bottom right, which minimizes the sum of all numbers along its path.

Note: You can only move either down or right at any point in time.

```js
function minPathSum(grid: number[][]): number {
  const m = grid.length;
  const n = grid[0].length;

  for (let i = 0; i < m; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      if (i == 0 && j == 0) continue;
      else if (i == 0) {
        grid[0][j] = grid[0][j - 1] + grid[0][j];
      } else if (j == 0 && i > 0) {
        grid[i][0] = grid[i][0] + grid[i - 1][0];
      } else {
        grid[i][j] = Math.min(grid[i][j - 1], grid[i - 1][j]) + grid[i][j];
      }
    }
  }

  return grid[m - 1][n - 1];
}
```

## Knapsack DP

To pinpoint a knapsack problem:

1.Check if the problem involves optimizing some value while staying within a constraint. This is the general requirement for a DP problem.
2.Check if there's a constraint involving a combination of elements to fulfill a certain capacity. Look for terms such as "size", "capacity", "space available", or "target".

518:You are given an integer array coins representing coins of different denominations and an integer amount representing a total amount of money.

Return the number of combinations that make up that amount. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return 0.

You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.

```js
function change(amount: number, coins: number[]): number {
  const dp = new Array(amount + 1).fill(0);
  dp[0] = 1;

  for (let i = 0; i < coins.length; i++) {
    for (let j = coins[i]; j <= amount; j++) {
      dp[j] += dp[j - coins[i]];
    }
  }

  return dp[amount];
}
```

## Dual-Sequence DP

Dual-sequence dynamic programming (DP) focuses on solutions derived from two linear sequences, such as arrays or strings. These problems mainly aim to compute a value concerning both sequences. A notable feature of numerous DP problems is their dependence on sequence prefixes.
