## Grid DP

64:Given a m x n grid filled with non-negative numbers, find a path from top left to bottom right, which minimizes the sum of all numbers along its path.

Note: You can only move either down or right at any point in time.

```js
function minPathSum(grid: number[][]): number {
  const m = grid.length;
  const n = grid[0].length;

  for (let i = 0; i < m; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      if (i == 0 && j == 0) continue;
      else if (i == 0) {
        grid[0][j] = grid[0][j - 1] + grid[0][j];
      } else if (j == 0 && i > 0) {
        grid[i][0] = grid[i][0] + grid[i - 1][0];
      } else {
        grid[i][j] = Math.min(grid[i][j - 1], grid[i - 1][j]) + grid[i][j];
      }
    }
  }

  return grid[m - 1][n - 1];
}
```

## Knapsack DP

To pinpoint a knapsack problem:

1.Check if the problem involves optimizing some value while staying within a constraint. This is the general requirement for a DP problem.
2.Check if there's a constraint involving a combination of elements to fulfill a certain capacity. Look for terms such as "size", "capacity", "space available", or "target".
