In general, a "client" can be any software or application that interacts with another service. For instance, a database client interacts with a database, an API client interacts with an API, and so on.

In web development,the term "client" can have a broader scope depending on the context. While "client" typically refers to the user's device or browser interacting with a server, it can also refer to any software or tool that interacts with a service or database.

### Client in a Broader Scope:

- In frontend development, "client" typically refers to the user's device or web browser.

* In backend development or database interactions, "client" refers to tools or libraries that interact with databases or external services.

Prisma Client is an example of a "client" in backend development that allows your server to interact with a database in a type-safe, intuitive way.

### what is prisma and prisma client?

- Prisma is an open-source ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool for Node.js and TypeScript applications. It helps developers interact with databases in a more intuitive and type-safe way.

- Prisma Client is the auto-generated, type-safe query builder that Prisma provides. It allows developers to easily perform database operations like creating, reading, updating, and deleting (CRUD) records in a database.

      - It is generated based on your database schema. It provides methods that allow your application to interact with the database without writing raw SQL queries.
      - This client operates within the server-side part of your application. When your server receives a request from a user (via the web client), it might use the Prisma Client to query or update the database as part of processing that request.
