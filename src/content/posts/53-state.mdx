### How to choose the state structure 
```js
import { useState } from 'react';

const initialItems = [
  { title: 'pretzels', id: 0 },
  { title: 'crispy seaweed', id: 1 },
  { title: 'granola bar', id: 2 },
];

export default function Menu() {
  const [items, setItems] = useState(initialItems);
  const [selectedItem, setSelectedItem] = useState(
    items[0]
  );

  function handleItemChange(id, e) {
    setItems(items.map(item => {
      if (item.id === id) {
        return {
          ...item,
          title: e.target.value,
        };
      } else {
        return item;
      }
    }));
  }

  return (
    <>
      <h2>What's your travel snack?</h2> 
      <ul>
        {items.map((item, index) => (
          <li key={item.id}>
            <input
              value={item.title}
              onChange={e => {
                handleItemChange(item.id, e)
              }}
            />
            {' '}
            <button onClick={() => {
              setSelectedItem(item);
            }}>Choose</button>
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
      <p>You picked {selectedItem.title}.</p>
    </>
  );
}
```
Currently, it stores the selected item as an object in the selectedItem state variable. However, this is not great: the contents of the selectedItem is the same object as one of the items inside the items list. This means that the information about the item itself is duplicated in two places.

Notice how if you first click “Choose” on an item and then edit it, the input updates but the label at the bottom does not reflect the edits. This is because you have duplicated state, and you forgot to update selectedItem.

Although you could update selectedItem too, an easier fix is to remove duplication. In this example, instead of a selectedItem object (which creates a duplication with objects inside items), you hold the selectedId in state, and then get the selectedItem by searching the items array for an item with that ID:
```js
import { useState } from 'react';

const initialItems = [
  { title: 'pretzels', id: 0 },
  { title: 'crispy seaweed', id: 1 },
  { title: 'granola bar', id: 2 },
];

export default function Menu() {
  const [items, setItems] = useState(initialItems);
  const [selectedId, setSelectedId] = useState(0);

  const selectedItem = items.find(item =>
    item.id === selectedId
  );

  function handleItemChange(id, e) {
    setItems(items.map(item => {
      if (item.id === id) {
        return {
          ...item,
          title: e.target.value,
        };
      } else {
        return item;
      }
    }));
  }

  return (
    <>
      <h2>What's your travel snack?</h2>
      <ul>
        {items.map((item, index) => (
          <li key={item.id}>
            <input
              value={item.title}
              onChange={e => {
                handleItemChange(item.id, e)
              }}
            />
            {' '}
            <button onClick={() => {
              setSelectedId(item.id);
            }}>Choose</button>
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
      <p>You picked {selectedItem.title}.</p>
    </>
  );
}

```
The state used to be duplicated like this:

```js 

items = [{ id: 0, title: 'pretzels'}, ...]
selectedItem = {id: 0, title: 'pretzels'}
But after the change it’s like this:

items = [{ id: 0, title: 'pretzels'}, ...]
selectedId = 0
```
The duplication is gone, and you only keep the essential state!

Now if you edit the selected item, the message below will update immediately. This is because setItems triggers a re-render, and items.find(...) would find the item with the updated title. You didn’t need to hold the selected item in state, because only the selected ID is essential. The rest could be calculated during render.

import Menu from "@/codeSnippet/state.tsx"

<Menu />

### what is the different between value and default value in React forms?

In React forms, value and defaultValue serve different purposes for managing the state of form text inputs. 

"value"

* Controlled Component: When you use value, you are creating a controlled component. This means that the form input's value is controlled by React state.
* Two-way Binding: The value of the input is directly tied to the component's state. To update the input, you need to update the state.
* Usage: when you need to have complete control over the input's value, such as for form validation or dynamic updates.

"defaultValue"
* Uncontrolled Component: When you use defaultValue, you are creating an uncontrolled component. The initial value is set, but React does not control its subsequent updates.
* Initial Value: The input gets an initial value, but it does not update based on state changes. Instead, the DOM itself maintains the value.
* Usage: Use defaultValue when you only need to set an initial value and don't need to control the input's state after the initial render.
