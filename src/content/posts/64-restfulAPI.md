## what is REST?

https://www.codecademy.com/article/what-is-rest

REST requires that a client make a request to the server in order to retrieve or modify data on the server. A request generally consists of:

- an HTTP verb(crud), which defines what kind of operation to perform
- a header, which allows the client to pass along information about the request
- a path to a resource
- an optional message body containing data
